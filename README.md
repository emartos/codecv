# CV Generator: Automated r√©sum√© creation tool

This project is an innovative **CV generator** leveraging **Large Language Models (LLM)** to analyze a Git repository and produce professional r√©sum√©s in multiple formats, including **Markdown**, **PDF**, and **LinkedIn-ready content**. Its primary goal is to automate r√©sum√© creation by utilizing a developer's contributions and commit history to highlight their skills and achievements.

## üì¶ Installation

### Step 1: Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cv-generator.git
cd cv-generator
```

### Step 2: Create and activate the virtual environment
```bash
make create-venv
```

### Step 3: Install dependencies
```bash
make install-requirements
```

### Step 4: Prepare configuration
```bash
make env
```
This will create an `.env` file if it does not exist. Update the file with the necessary configuration.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

To run the application, use:

```bash
make run
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Makefile commands

Here is a list of **Makefile** commands to streamline various tasks within the project:

### üìÇ Environment setup
- **`make create-venv`**: Creates the virtual environment if it does not exist.
- **`make install-requirements`**: Installs all dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
- **`make freeze-requirements`**: Updates the `requirements.txt` file with the current environment.
- **`make env`**: Creates the `.env` file from a template, if it doesn't exist.
- **`make delete-venv`**: Deletes the virtual environment.

### üõ† Code quality and pre-commit
- **`make lint`**: Runs `flake8` for linting the code.
- **`make pre-commit`**: Runs all pre-commit hooks on the codebase.
- **`make check-format`**: Validates the code format with `isort` and `black`.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Application execution
- **`make run`**: Runs the main application.

### üßπ Cleanup and maintenance
- **`make clean`**: Removes temporary files (`__pycache__`, `.pyc`, etc.).
- **`make delete-venv`**: Deletes the virtual environment.

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Utilities
- **`make help`**: Displays all available commands along with a brief description.

> **Tip**: Use `make help` to quickly list all make commands.

## üìë Example workflow

To generate a r√©sum√©, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize the environment**:
   ```bash
   make create-venv
   make install-requirements
   make env
   ```

2. **Run pre-commit for code validation**:
   ```bash
   make pre-commit
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   make run
   ```

4. **Output**:
   - The r√©sum√© will be generated in the desired format (Markdown, PDF, or LinkedIn) and saved in the output directory.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Running the application without or with `.env` Configuration

You can run the program both with and without initializing the `.env` configuration file. Here's how:

### Without using the `.env` file

If you choose not to set up a `.env` file, the program will ask you for required inputs during runtime. Follow these steps:

1. Ensure your project and virtual environment are set up:
   ```bash
   make create-venv
   make install-requirements
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   make run
   ```
   - The application will interactively prompt you for the required inputs such as repository path, author name, email, etc.

3. Output:
   - The r√©sum√© will be generated in the desired format and saved in the `output/` directory.

### Using the `.env` file

The `.env` file allows you to predefine input configurations to run the program smoothly without prompts.

1. Generate the `.env` file template:
   ```bash
   make env
   ```

2. Open the `.env` file in a text editor and fill in the necessary values. Example:
   ```dotenv
   REPO_PATH=/path/to/your/repository
   AUTHOR_NAME=John Doe
   AUTHOR_EMAIL=john.doe@example.com
   EXPORT_FORMAT=pdf
   ```

3. Save and close the `.env` file.

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   make run
   ```

5. Output:
   - The r√©sum√© will be automatically generated in the pre-configured format and saved in the `output/` directory.

## üöß Limitations

1. **Dependency on commit message quality**:  
   The system relies on the quality of commit messages to generate summaries and insights. Sending all code changes to
   the LLM would be an alternative, but this could exceed processing limits due to the large volume of data.

2. **Limited technology coverage**:  
   The detected technologies are exclusively based on the project's code. Technologies related to infrastructure
   (e.g., CI/CD, operating systems, etc.) are not included in the detection scope.
